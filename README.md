# Moisture Sensor and DHT11 Data Sending to MongoDB

## Description

This repository contains the code and documentation for an IoT project that utilizes a moisture sensor and a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor to gather environmental data. The data collected is then sent to a MongoDB database for storage, analysis, and visualization.

## Features

- Real-time data collection from moisture sensor and DHT11 sensor.
- Seamless integration with MongoDB for data storage.
- Scalable and efficient data processing and transmission.
- Easily adaptable for various IoT applications.
- Simple setup and usage.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (list them if any).
3. Connect the moisture sensor and DHT11 sensor to your IoT device.
4. Configure the MongoDB connection settings.
5. Run the main script to start data collection and transmission.

## Usage

1. Modify the data collection interval or settings as per your requirements.
2. Access the MongoDB database to retrieve and analyze the stored data.
3. Implement visualizations or further analysis as needed.
